Recorded Demo of the project.
## *2. Description :thinking:*
  - Used Open-CV and its default functions to access the webcam and get the contours.<br/>
  - Red and Blue objects will be detected as contour for playing the drum in the code(however i used only one and both can be used by uncommenting the required codes if required)<br/>
  - With the help of the getCountours function of Open-CV i was able to access the stick(the red or blue contour area).<br/>
  - When the stick was in the range of the rectangular boxes with text of sounds like Tom,Hit-Hat,etc. music was played in the if statement.<br/> 
  - The mp3 and wav files were played in the previous step with the help of pygame library(mixer function).<br/>
  - Finally when key was '27' which is 'esc' key , then the code ends and all windows are terminated.<br/>
